This repository is an example of how to set up a research compendium using the R package structure as a blueprint. It includes unit test and a simple continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions.

This repository was created for a workshop at the virtual YoMos meeting 2020.

You can find the presentation and step by step instructions on how to set up your own project [here](https://selinazitrone.github.io/YoMos2020/index.html)
