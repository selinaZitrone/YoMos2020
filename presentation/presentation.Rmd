## Workshop overview

### Motivation

* reproducibility
* transparency
* good coding practice

### What will you learn?
* clear project structure
* good programming practice
  + unit testing
  + CI with github Actions
* holepunch
* code on github. [https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020](https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020)


## Clear project structure

* follow the conventions of your research community / lab
* clear separation of data, method and output
* specify the computational environment
 
* adapt R package stucture for your research compendia

### Advantages

* benefit from quality control mechanisms needed to build your R package (<code>R CMD check</code>)
* writing functions is less error prone
* functions can be easily documented

* other packages generating empty project directory structures: 
  + ProjectTemplate
  + prodigenr
  + workflowr

## Unit testing

What is it?

Why should I do it?

How should I do it?

## Continous integration

### Why?

* Idea of CI: integrate your code frequently
* smaller changes are easier to handle
* get quick and frequent feedback

### How?

## Github Actions

## Reproducibility and Accessaiility
