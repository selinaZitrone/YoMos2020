## Workshop overview

### Motivation

* reproducibility
* transparency
* good coding practice

### What will you learn?
* clear project structure
* good programming practice
  + unit testing
  + CI with github Actions
* holepunch
* code on github. [https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020](https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020)


## Clear project structure

* follow the conventions of your research community / lab
* clear separation of data, method and output
* specify the computational environment
 
* adapt R package stucture for your research compendia

### Advantages

* benefit from quality control mechanisms needed to build your R package (<code>R CMD check</code>)
* writing functions is less error prone
* functions can be easily documented

* other packages generating empty project directory structures: 
  + ProjectTemplate
  + prodigenr
  + workflowr
</div>


## Unit testing {.smaller}

* test individual units of source code to see if it is fit for use 

### Why?

* Fewer bugs
* Better code structure
* Easier to pick up where you left
* Robust code
* You can rerun your tests at anytime to make sure you did not break anything

### How?

* Test external interfaces of functions
* One test for each behaviour
* Test fragile, complicated code
* Write a test if you find a but
* Test-first philosophy: write the test first, then write the code to pass it
* in R: <code>testthat</code> package (Hadley Wickham)

## Continous integration (CI)

### Idea

* shared code repository (e.g. on github)
* integrate code frequently (every day) to the shared
* automated builds and tests after each commit
* code is only accepted if it builds and passes the test
* everyone can see the results of the lates commit
</div>
---

### Why?

* smaller changes are easier to handle
* get quick and frequent feedback
* early bug detection
* constant availability of current code version
* if you have to revert the codebase due to bugs you won't lose that much

* However, can be time consuming and might be overkill for small or solo projects

## Github Actions for CI

* supports mac-OS, windows, linux, docker containers
* integration with github, so no seperate setup and authentification
* free for open source, academic or educational repos
* 20 concurrent jobs (40 with pro), 6 h per job, 72 h per workflow
* self host to remove the per job limit
* very easy to setup with R using the <code>usethis</code> package
