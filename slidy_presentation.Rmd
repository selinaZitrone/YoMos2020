# Workshop overview
## Three main topics

> - research compendia
> - version control (Git)
> - automated testing (CI with GitHub actions)
> - (holepunch)
> - code on github. [https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020](https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020)

# Motivations for a better project organization and workflow
> - Reproduciblity üîÉ (for you and others)
> - Reliablity üèã (will it work again?)
> - Re-usablity ‚öô (don't re-invent the wheel)
> - Visiblity üîç (let others see and use your work)

# How? Use a research compendium!

* It's an üì¶ R Package!
* packages generating similar project directory structures: 
  + rrtools
  + ProjectTemplate
  + prodigenr
  + workflowr

## Advantages of using R Packages

* benefit from quality control mechanisms needed to build your R package (<code>R CMD check</code>)
* writing functions is less error prone
* functions can be easily documented

# Hands-on: Create a research compendium

# Git as a distributed version control system (VCS)

* complete and long-term history of every file in your project
  + go back to specific versions of your project
* collaborate in teams
  + branching and merging
  + tracability: each change is commented and can be traced back to a developer
* host your repository on remote server (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...)
  + open-source collaborative development
  + visibility: get new collaborators, feedback, bug reports
  
# Hands-on: initialize a rempository on GithHub from R-Studio

# Testing
## Unit testing {.smaller}

* test individual units of source code to see if it is fit for use 

### Why?

* Fewer bugs
* Better code structure
* Easier to pick up where you left
* Robust code
* You can rerun your tests at anytime to make sure you did not break anything

### How?

* Test external interfaces of functions
* One test for each behaviour
* Test fragile, complicated code
* Write a test if you find a but
* Test-first philosophy: write the test first, then write the code to pass it
* in R: <code>testthat</code> package (Hadley Wickham)


# Continous integration (CI)

> "If it hurts, do it more often" (Martin Fowler)

### Idea

* shared code repository (e.g. on github)
* integrate code frequently (every day) to the shared
* automated builds and tests after each commit
* code is only accepted if it builds and passes the test
* everyone can see the results of the lates commit

---

### Why?

* smaller changes are easier to handle
* get quick and frequent feedback
* early bug detection
* constant availability of current code version
* if you have to revert the codebase due to bugs you won't lose that much

* However, can be time consuming and might be overkill for small or solo projects

# Github Actions for CI

* supports mac-OS, windows, linux, docker containers
* integration with github, so no seperate setup and authentification
* free for open source, academic or educational repos
* 20 concurrent jobs (40 with pro), 6 h per job, 72 h per workflow
* self host to remove the per job limit
* very easy to setup with R using the <code>usethis</code> package

# Reproducibility and Accessaiblity
