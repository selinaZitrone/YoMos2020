## Workshop overview

### What will you learn?
* clear project structure
* good programming practice
  + unit testing
  + CI with github Actions
* holepunch
* code on github. [https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020](https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020)


# Goals
## üîÉ Reproducible (for you and others)
- script everything, avoid manual steps
- explain the workflow
- specify the computational environment

## üèã Reliable (will it work again?)
- use automated testing
- collaborate and share

## ‚öô Re-usable (don't re-invent the wheel)
- follow the conventions of your research community / lab
- clear separation of data, code and output
- pick a license to allow others to use your work

## üîç Visible (let others see and use your work)
- "Go public" (Mr. Obvious)
- üîÉ + üèã + ‚öô encourages others to trust your work

# How? Use a research compendium!

* It's an üì¶ R Package!
* packages generating similar project directory structures: 
  + rrtools
  + ProjectTemplate
  + prodigenr
  + workflowr  
</div>

## Advantages of using R Packages

* benefit from quality control mechanisms needed to build your R package (<code>R CMD check</code>)
* writing functions is less error prone
* functions can be easily documented

# Hands-on: Create a research compendium

# Git as a distributed version control system (VCS)

* complete and long-term history of every file in your project
  + go back to specific versions of your project
* collaborate in teams
  + branching and merging
  + tracability: each change is commented and can be traced back a developer
* host your repository on remote server (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...)
  + open-source collaborative development
  + visibility: get new collaborators, feedback, bug reports

 
# Tesing

## Unit testing {.smaller}

* test individual units of source code to see if it is fit for use 

### Why?

* Fewer bugs
* Better code structure
* Easier to pick up where you left
* Robust code
* You can rerun your tests at anytime to make sure you did not break anything

### How?

* Test external interfaces of functions
* One test for each behaviour
* Test fragile, complicated code
* Write a test if you find a but
* Test-first philosophy: write the test first, then write the code to pass it
* in R: <code>testthat</code> package (Hadley Wickham)

## Continous integration (CI)

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>

### Idea

* shared code repository (e.g. on github)
* integrate code frequently (every day) to the shared
* automated builds and tests after each commit
* code is only accepted if it builds and passes the test
* everyone can see the results of the lates commit
</div>
---

### Why?

* smaller changes are easier to handle
* get quick and frequent feedback
* early bug detection
* constant availability of current code version
* if you have to revert the codebase due to bugs you won't lose that much

* However, can be time consuming and might be overkill for small or solo projects

## Github Actions for CI

* supports mac-OS, windows, linux, docker containers
* integration with github, so no seperate setup and authentification
* free for open source, academic or educational repos
* 20 concurrent jobs (40 with pro), 6 h per job, 72 h per workflow
* self host to remove the per job limit
* very easy to setup with R using the <code>usethis</code> package
