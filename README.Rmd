# Step 1: Create an empty R-package
Create an Rpackage in R-Studio: File -> New Project -> New Directory

To initialize the package with a git repository click the checkmark when creating the project.
If you created the package withouth a git repository you can either use 

```r
usethis::use_git()
```
or you can initialize an empty git repository from the terminal

```sh
git init
```
Go to the DESCRIPTION file and fill in your data

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79s3z0gIuFU&list=PLk3B5c8iCV-T4LM0mwEyWIunIunLyEjqM&index=1) you can find a good tutorial showing all the R package building basics and more.

# Step2: Add a readme
This adds an rmd to the package that can be rendered to github in the readme section.
```r
usethis::use_readem_rmd()
```
# Step 2: import your data and scripts
If you already have data and scripts that you want to use in this package, you can import them now

Organize them in a way that model, data and R scripts are in seperate folders. @Marwick2018 give a good overview on how to sturcture reserach compendiums so that it is clear and easy to access to others that want to reproduce your results.

# Step 3: commit your changes

In the git panel (next to build) you can first stage all file and then commit them or you can do it from the commandline:

```sh
git add *
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

# Step 4: initialize github repository

You can either do this by manually setting up a git repository and adding this package to the repository or, more conveniently you can do it using the usethis package.
To do this step you need to have a PAT (personal access token) for github added to your .Renviron file. You can find a step by step guide on how to do this in the [Happy Git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#github-pat).

```r
usethis::use_github()
```
# Step 5: Unit testing

create the files and testfolders needed by the thestthat package

```r
usethis::use_testthat
```

You can then can initialize a basic test file by doing
```r
usethis::use_test()
```

# Step 6: Set up Continous Integration (CI) pipeline with github actions

Setup github actions from R

This creates the basic file structure needed to set up your workflow and automatically adds a R-CMD-check.yaml file
```r
usethis::use_github_actions()
```
If you want to use an action that already exists (e.g. from the r-lib/actions) repository you can do the following:

```r
usethis::use_github_action("render-readme.yaml")
```
This adds the respective file to ./github/workflows

# Notes
If you need another package in your R-package (e.g. ggplot2) you can use 
```r
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
```
This will add the ggplot2 packages to the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file, meaning it is importet when you load the package
