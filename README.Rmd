# General Setup

## Step 1: Create an empty R-package
Create an R-package in R-Studio: File -> New Project -> New Directory

To initialize the package with a git repository click the checkmark when creating the project.
If you created the package without a git repository you can either use 

```r
usethis::use_git()
```
or you can initialize an empty git repository from the terminal

```sh
git init
```

First, go to the DESCRIPTION file and fill in your data. E.g.
```
Package: YoMos2020
Type: Package
Title: Example of Good Scientific Programming Practice
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Selina and Sebastian
Maintainer: Selina Baldauf <selina.baldauf@fu-berlin.de>
Description: A package that is used as an example to demonstrate clear project strucure, unit testing, 
  continous integration with github actions,and reproducibility directly from github using the holepunch package.
License: GPL-3
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
URL: https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020
BugReports: https://github.com/selinaZitrone/YoMos2020/issues
Imports:
    dplyr,
    rmarkdown,
    ggplot2
Suggests: 
    testthat
```

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79s3z0gIuFU&list=PLk3B5c8iCV-T4LM0mwEyWIunIunLyEjqM&index=1) you can find a good tutorial showing all the R package building basics and more.

To add package dependencies to your R-package (e.g. ggplot2) you can use 
```r
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
```
This will add the ggplot2 packages to the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file, meaning it is imported when you load the package.

## Step 2: Add a readme file
This adds an rmd to the package that can be rendered to github in the readme section.
```r
usethis::use_readme_rmd() # or use_readme_md() if you want to use plain Markdown
```

## Step 2: Import your data and scripts
If you already have data and scripts that you want to use in this package, you can import them now.

Organize them in a way that model, data and R scripts are in separate folders. @Marwick2018 give a good overview on how to structure research compendiums so that it is clear and easy to access to others that want to reproduce your results.

# Setup Git and GitHub

## Step 1: Commit your changes locally

In the `Git` tab (next to build) you can first stage all file and then commit them or you can do it from the command line:

```sh
git add *
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

## Step 2: Initialize your Github repository

You can either do this by manually setting up a git repository and adding this package to the repository or, more conveniently, you can do it using the `usethis` package.
To do this step you need to have a PAT (personal access token) for github added to your .Renviron file. You can find a step by step guide on how to do this in the [Happy Git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#github-pat).

```r
usethis::use_github()
```
# Unit testing

create the files and test folders needed by the `thestthat` package

```r
usethis::use_testthat
```

You can then can initialize a basic test file by doing
```r
usethis::use_test() # creates a test for the file that is currently open in RSudio
```

# Setup a Continous Integration (CI) pipeline with GitHub actions

## Setup github actions from R

This creates the basic file structure needed to set up your workflow and automatically adds a R-CMD-check.yaml file
```r
usethis::use_github_actions()
```
If you want to use an action that already exists (e.g. from the r-lib/actions) repository you can do the following:

```r
usethis::use_github_action("render-readme.yaml")
```
This adds the respective file to ./github/workflows

# Add RStudio server with `holepunch`
There is a nice intro for holepunch: [Getting started with holepunch](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/articles/getting_started.html).
The code below is copied'n'pasted from the [holepunch repo's readme](https://github.com/karthik/holepunch).
```r
remotes::install_github("karthik/holepunch")

write_dockerfile(maintainer = "your_name") 
# To write a Dockerfile. It will automatically pick the date of the last 
# modified file, match it to that version of R and add it here. You can 
# override this by passing r_date to some arbitrary date
# (but one for which a R version exists).

generate_badge() # This generates a badge for your readme.
